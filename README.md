## Troubleshooting
*Is the game not starting?*

- Try clearing out other mods that you believe may be conflicting with this mod

*Does this work with Ryujinx?*

- Ryujinx is a little different as their mod folder is located within %appdata% --> sdcard --> atmosphere --> contents --> 01006a800016e000 --> romfs --> skyline --> (drag .nro files into here). Our mod is already simplified so that all you need to do is go into: %appdata% --> sdcard. While in the sdcard folder, drag and drop the mod files in, if you installed skyline previously it'll ask to replace some files so that's up to you whether or not you want to replace your previous ARCropolis folder or not with the one that comes prepackaged within our mod. Once it's dragged in you're ready to go!
